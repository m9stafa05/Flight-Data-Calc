# Aircraft Performance Calculator

A Dart-based calculator for analyzing aircraft performance parameters. This tool helps calculate various flight characteristics including:

- Lift and drag forces
- Thrust and power requirements
- Rate of climb
- Excess thrust and power
- Parasite and induced drag

## Features
- Interactive command-line interface
- Configurable aircraft parameters
- Default values for quick calculations
- Detailed performance metrics output

## Usage
The calculator accepts inputs for:
- Altitude
- Thrust available
- Power available
- Custom aircraft parameters (optional)

## Technical Details
The program uses fundamental aerodynamic equations to compute:
- Lift coefficient (CL)
- Parasite drag (Do)
- Induced drag (Di)
- Total drag
- Thrust required
- Power required
- Rate of climb (both thrust and power-based calculations)

Built with Dart, this calculator provides a practical tool for aircraft performance analysis and educational purposes.
